# AI Document Organizer V2 Documentation

## Project Overview

The AI Document Organizer V2 represents a significant evolution from the original AI Document Organizer, transitioning from a monolithic architecture to a modular, plugin-based system. This architectural shift enables greater extensibility, maintainability, and customization while preserving compatibility with the original system.

## Key Features

- **Plugin Architecture**: Modular system with standardized interfaces
- **AI-Powered Analysis**: Integration with Google Gemini and OpenAI
- **Multi-Format Support**: Processing for documents, images, audio, and video
- **Advanced Organization**: Intelligent categorization and relationship detection
- **Extensibility**: Easy addition of new formats and capabilities

## Architecture

The AI Document Organizer V2 is built on a plugin architecture with four primary plugin types:

1. **Parser Plugins**: Handle file reading and content extraction
2. **Analyzer Plugins**: Process content and extract insights
3. **Organizer Plugins**: Manage file categorization and storage
4. **Utility Plugins**: Provide auxiliary functionality

All plugins share a common lifecycle through the BasePlugin interface, with specialized interfaces for each plugin type.

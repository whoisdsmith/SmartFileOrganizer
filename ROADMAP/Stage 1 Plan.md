# Stage 1 Implementation Plan

This document outlines the detailed implementation plan for Stage 1 of the Smart File Organizer enhancement project. Stage 1 focuses on core file support expansion with four key features.

## 1. PDF Support

### Tasks

1. **Research and Select PDF Library**
   - Compare PyPDF2 and pdfplumber for features, performance, and maintenance status

   - Select the most appropriate library based on testing results

2. **Update Dependencies**
   - Add the selected PDF library to requirements.txt
   - Add any additional dependencies required for PDF processing

3. **Implement PDF Parsing in `file_parser.py`**
   - Create a new method `_parse_pdf()` in the FileParser class
   - Implement text extraction from PDF files
   - Handle potential encoding issues
   - Add error handling for corrupted or password-protected PDFs

4. **Implement PDF Metadata Extraction**
   - Extract common PDF metadata (author, title, creation date, etc.)
   - Extract PDF-specific metadata (page count, PDF version, etc.)
   - Add metadata to the file information dictionary

5. **Update File Analyzer**
   - Add '.pdf' to the supported_extensions dictionary in `file_analyzer.py`
   - Test PDF analysis with various PDF types

6. **GUI Updates**
   - Add PDF icon/representation in the file list
   - Update file type filters to include PDF

7. **Testing**
   - Test with various PDF types (simple text, complex layouts, forms, etc.)
   - Test with large PDFs to ensure performance
   - Test with corrupted or malformed PDFs to ensure error handling

## 2. Duplicate File Detection

### Tasks

1. **Create Duplicate Detector Module**
   - Create a new file `duplicate_detector.py`
   - Implement DuplicateDetector class with core functionality

2. **Implement Exact Duplicate Detection**
   - Implement file hash calculation (MD5, SHA-1, or SHA-256)
   - Create hash-based file comparison functionality
   - Optimize for large file sets with dictionary-based lookups

3. **Implement Near-Duplicate Detection**
   - Research and implement content-based similarity algorithms
   - Add configurable similarity thresholds
   - Implement file content sampling for large files

4. **Create Duplicate Handling Options**
   - Implement options for handling duplicates (keep newest, keep oldest, keep largest, etc.)
   - Add functionality to move duplicates to a separate folder
   - Add functionality to generate duplicate reports

5. **Integrate with File Organizer**
   - Add duplicate detection options to `file_organizer.py`
   - Implement duplicate handling during file organization
   - Add duplicate information to file metadata

6. **GUI Integration**
   - Create a duplicate detection tab/panel in the GUI
   - Add visualization of duplicate file groups
   - Implement duplicate handling controls
   - Add progress indicators for duplicate scanning

7. **Testing**
   - Test with exact duplicates across different folders
   - Test with near-duplicates with varying similarity
   - Test performance with large file sets
   - Test duplicate handling options

## 3. Advanced Search Functionality

### Tasks

1. **Create Search Engine Module**
   - Create a new file `search_engine.py`
   - Implement SearchEngine class with core functionality

2. **Implement Basic Search Indexing**
   - Create a database schema for search indexing (SQLite)
   - Implement file indexing functionality
   - Add incremental indexing for new/modified files

3. **Implement Search Query Processing**
   - Create query parser for advanced search syntax
   - Implement search by filename, content, and metadata
   - Add support for boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT)

4. **Add Search Filters**
   - Implement filtering by file type
   - Implement filtering by category
   - Implement filtering by date ranges
   - Implement filtering by file size

5. **Create Search Results Handling**
   - Implement search results sorting (relevance, date, size, etc.)
   - Add pagination for large result sets
   - Implement result highlighting

6. **GUI Integration**
   - Create a search interface in the GUI
   - Add advanced search options panel
   - Implement search results display
   - Add result navigation and actions

7. **Testing**
   - Test search accuracy with various queries
   - Test search performance with large file sets
   - Test filter combinations
   - Test edge cases (empty queries, all files matching, etc.)

## 4. Document Tagging System

### Tasks

1. **Extend File Organizer with Tagging**
   - Add tagging functionality to `file_organizer.py`
   - Implement tag storage and retrieval
   - Add batch tagging operations

2. **Create Tag Management System**
   - Extend `settings_manager.py` with tag management
   - Implement tag creation, editing, and deletion
   - Add tag categories and hierarchies
   - Implement tag import/export

3. **Implement AI-Suggested Tags**
   - Enhance AI analysis to generate relevant tags
   - Implement confidence scoring for suggested tags
   - Add user feedback mechanism for improving suggestions

4. **Add Tag-Based Organization**
   - Implement file organization by tags
   - Add tag-based filtering options
   - Create tag-based views and grouping

5. **GUI Integration**
   - Add tag management interface
   - Implement tag assignment UI
   - Create tag cloud/list visualization
   - Add tag-based filtering controls

6. **Testing**
   - Test tag assignment and removal
   - Test tag-based organization
   - Test AI tag suggestions with various file types
   - Test performance with large numbers of tags

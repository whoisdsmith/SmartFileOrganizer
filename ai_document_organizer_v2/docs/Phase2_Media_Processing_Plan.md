# Phase 2: Media Processing Implementation Plan

This document outlines the detailed implementation plan for Phase 2 of the AI Document Organizer V2 project, focusing on media processing capabilities.

## Overview

Phase 2 extends the system's capabilities to handle audio and video files, providing advanced analysis, metadata extraction, and integration with transcription services. This phase builds upon the successful plugin architecture established in Phase 1.

## Components

### 1. Audio Analyzer Plugin

#### Core Functionality
- Audio file format detection and validation
- Metadata extraction (artist, album, title, genre, year, etc.)
- Audio quality analysis (bitrate, sample rate, channels)
- Duration calculation and segment detection
- Waveform generation and visualization

#### Integration Points
- Transcription service integration
- AI analysis of transcribed content
- Tag extraction and categorization

#### Implementation Steps
1. Create plugin directory structure and base files
2. Implement audio file detection and format validation
3. Develop metadata extraction using libraries like `mutagen`
4. Implement waveform generation with `matplotlib` or similar
5. Add transcription integration with configurable providers
6. Develop content analysis pipeline for transcribed audio
7. Create comprehensive test cases and documentation

#### Technical Requirements
- Support for common audio formats (MP3, WAV, FLAC, AAC, OGG)
- Configurable settings for analysis depth and features
- Performance optimization for large audio files
- Graceful dependency handling and fallbacks

### 2. Video Analyzer Plugin

#### Core Functionality
- Video file format detection and validation
- Metadata extraction (resolution, codec, frame rate, etc.)
- Thumbnail/preview generation at configurable intervals
- Scene detection and keyframe extraction
- Duration analysis and chapter detection (if available)

#### Advanced Features
- Object and face detection in video frames
- Text extraction from video frames (OCR)
- Subtitle/caption extraction and analysis
- Content summarization based on visual elements

#### Implementation Steps
1. Create plugin directory structure and base files
2. Implement video file detection and format validation
3. Develop metadata extraction using libraries like `ffmpeg-python`
4. Implement thumbnail generation at regular intervals
5. Add scene detection and keyframe extraction
6. Develop frame analysis pipeline for object/face detection
7. Create comprehensive test cases and documentation

#### Technical Requirements
- Support for common video formats (MP4, AVI, MOV, MKV, WebM)
- Configurable settings for extraction depth and features
- Performance optimization for large video files
- Graceful dependency handling with optional features

### 3. Transcription Service Integration

#### Core Functionality
- Modular design supporting multiple transcription providers
- Local transcription using open-source models
- Cloud transcription service integration
- Transcription caching and result management
- Quality assessment and confidence scoring

#### Implementation Steps
1. Design transcription service interface and abstract base class
2. Implement local transcription using models like Whisper
3. Add cloud service integrations (Google Speech-to-Text, etc.)
4. Develop caching system for transcription results
5. Create configuration system for transcription preferences
6. Implement quality and confidence metrics

#### Technical Requirements
- Provider-agnostic interface for transcription services
- Support for multiple languages and dialects
- Configurable quality vs. speed tradeoffs
- Efficient caching mechanism for transcript storage

## Integration with Existing System

### Plugin Manager Extensions
- Update plugin discovery to detect media processing plugins
- Add media-specific plugin categories and interfaces
- Extend settings system for media processing configurations

### User Interface Enhancements
- Add media file preview capabilities
- Implement waveform/spectrum visualization for audio
- Create video timeline and keyframe browsing
- Develop transcription viewing and editing interface

### Analysis Pipeline Integration
- Extend document relationship finding to include media files
- Implement cross-media content analysis
- Develop media-specific organization rules and categories

## Performance Considerations

### Resource Management
- Implement worker pool for parallel media processing
- Add progress reporting for long-running operations
- Develop resource monitoring for memory-intensive operations
- Create cancellation and pause/resume capabilities

### Optimization Strategies
- Implement lazy loading for media content
- Add configurable analysis depth based on file size
- Develop thumbnail/preview caching system
- Create adaptive processing based on available system resources

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Component-level tests for each module
- Media format detection and validation tests
- Metadata extraction accuracy verification

### Integration Tests
- End-to-end processing pipeline verification
- Plugin interaction and data exchange tests
- Error handling and recovery testing

### Performance Tests
- Load testing with large media collections
- Memory usage profiling and optimization
- Processing time benchmarks for various file types

## Deliverables

1. Audio analyzer plugin with full metadata extraction
2. Video analyzer plugin with frame extraction and analysis
3. Transcription service integration with multiple providers
4. Comprehensive test suite for all components
5. Documentation including API references and usage examples
6. Sample media files for demonstration and testing
